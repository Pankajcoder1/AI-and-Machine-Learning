#ai and ml projects.

#### denoising.py -> 
this file contains an Sequential model(auto-encoder) of keras library and removes the noise of images i worked on this model using mnist and fashion mnist dataset. I am looking forward to integrate it with mobile camera so that real time noisy images and videos becomes clear.

#### noise_generator.ipynb-> 
in this file I tried to create artificial noise to add in dataset to train model on noisy images.

#### image_resolution.ipynb-> 
in this file Sequential model(auto-encoder) from keras lybrary is trained on low resolution images(blur images) to high-resolution imges.I trained this model on some real examples as well as fashion-mnist dataset it worked quite well.
